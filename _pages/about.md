I graduated from UC Santa Barbara in 2019 with a B.S in Physics and now currently attend Oregon State University, studying Computer Science for my M.S. My area of focus is in computer graphics with a specific emphasis on physically based simulation/animation.

It is my goal to work in industry developing and researching technologies for the tooling used by artists and programmers in the video game and movie industries.

I'm currently a computational scientist at LaunchPoint EPS where I have helped develop a design optimization tool for electric motors using physical models in electrodynamics.
