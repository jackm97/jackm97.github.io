Scalix is a data parallel computing framework designed to provide an easy-to-use interface for designing data parallel
applications that automatically scale to the available compute resources. Data distribution and load balancing are
abstracted away from the user, allowing them to focus on the application logic. Scalix is designed to be written using "
kernel style" programming, where the user writes a single function that is executed on a grid of threads.
